After more than five months, we have finally released xsAI 0.4.

## Why is it taking so long?

I planned to implement many new features in version 0.4,
but upon writing the code, I found some of them to be quite challenging.

Additionally, I've created a lot of new projects... (This is the main reason)

I ultimately postponed these features:

- [Responses API](https://github.com/moeru-ai/xsai/issues/100)
- [prepareStep](https://github.com/moeru-ai/xsai/issues/184)

But don't worry - this version still has quite a few new features.

btw, this codename is also a song by Kizuna AI and you can listen to it while reading:

Alright, let's take a look:

## All-In-One Providers

## Reasoning Content

## Stream Transcription

## Telemetry

## Standard JSON Schema

xsSchema now prioritizes [Standard JSON Schema](https://standardschema.dev/json-schema), though this change is not currently reflected at the user level.

In the next version, I will attempt to fully migrate and make xsSchema optional.
